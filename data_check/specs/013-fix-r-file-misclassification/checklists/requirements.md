# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix R File Misclassification and CSV Read Errors

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-18

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- SC-004 (count of data files for paper 09567976211040491 drops from 378) is based on observed pipeline output; actual correct count can only be verified by running the fixed pipeline.
- The `.txt`/`.dat` ambiguity exclusion from FR-007 is intentional and documented in Assumptions.
