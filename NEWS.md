# papercheck 0.0.0.9054

* `osf_file_download()` now also retrieves files from linked storage
* Removed the last dependency to {osfr} and updated `osf_check_id()` to return expected IDs from various URLs
* OSF functions added to getting started vignette
* Functions that require and API are now tested using httptest
* module_list() doesn't fail if there are any errors in the modules

# papercheck 0.0.0.9053

* Updated `read()` to parse more stupid date formats that turn up in the submission string (and added the unparsed submission string back just in case)
* Completely overhauled how paper objects handle references. 
    - the `paper$reference` table is now `paper$bib`
    - the `paper$citations` table is now `paper$xrefs` and also contains  information for internal cross-references to figures, tables, footnotes, and formulae
    - the `ref_id` and `bib_id` in both tables is now `xref_id`
    - the `xrefs` table also contains location information (section, div, p, s) for the sentence containing the cross-ref, so you can use `expand_text()` 
    - The `read()` function now returns paper objects with these new tables, so you will need to re-read any XML files (if you have stored the papercheck list as Rdata)
    - The `psychsci` object has been updated for this new format
    - Modules and vignettes have been updated as well

# papercheck 0.0.0.9052

* Fixed a bug in `expand_text()` where expanded sentences were duplicated if there are multiple matches from the same sentence in the data frame.
* Updated the `retractionwatch` table
* Fixed a bug in `read()` that omitted paper DOIs from paper$info
* Updated `read()` to add correctly parsed "accepted" and "received" dates to paper\$info (replaces paper\$submission string) (ISO 8601 is the only correct date format!)
* Updated `psychsci` for new info structure

# papercheck 0.0.0.9051

* Small bug fixes to `osf_file_download()`
* `osf_file_download()` now returns a table of file info, including info for files not downloaded because of file size limits

# papercheck 0.0.0.9050

* Added `read()` function, which superceeds `read_grobid()`, `read_cermine()` and `read_text()` (they are still available, but are now just aliases to `read()`). This should work with XML files in TEI (grobid), JATS APA-DTD, NLM-DTD and cermine formats, plus full text-only parsing of .docx and plain text files.
* Added `osf_file_download()` function, which downloads all files under a project or node and structures them the same as the project.

# papercheck 0.0.0.9049

* Updated `read_grobid()` to classify headers as intro, method, results, discussion with better accuracy (to handle garbled headers)

# papercheck 0.0.0.9048

* Functions to check ResearchBox.org (`rbox_links()` and `rbox_retrieve()`) -- very preliminary

# papercheck 0.0.0.9047

* fixed some bugs in osf and aspredicted functions (mainly around dealing with private or empty projects)
* added rvest dependency for better webpage parsing

* New related blog post
* General bug fixes in newer stuff
* Updated license to AGPL (GNU Affero General Public License)

# papercheck 0.0.0.9045

* When reading a paper with `read_grobid()`, the paper$references table now contains new columns for bibtype, title, journal, year, and authors to facilitate reference checks, and more reliably pulls DOIs.
* The `psychsci` set has  been updated for the new reference tables
* fixed bug in `info_table()` where adding "id" to the items argument borked the id column
* Added `json_expand()` function to expand JSON-formatted LLM responses
* Updated the LLM examples in the vignettes
* Added `find_project` argument to `osf_retrieve()` to make searching for the parent project optional (it takes 1+ API calls)
* Added `emojis` for convenience

* Build pkgdown manually 

# papercheck 0.0.0.9041

* Combined the two effect size modules into "effect_size"
* Renamed the module "imprecise_p" to "exact_p" (I keep typo-ing "imprecise")
* Added a loading message
* Added code coverage at https://app.codecov.io/gh/scienceverse/papercheck
* updated "all_p_values" to handle unicode operators like <=or >>

# papercheck 0.0.0.9040

* Updated default llm model to llama-3.3-70b-versatile (old one is being deprecated in August)
* Updated reporting function for modules to show the summary table
* Fixes a bug in `validate()` that returned FALSE for matches if the expected and observed results were both `NA`

* the validation, metascience, and text_model vignettes are updated
* modules can now use relative paths (to their own location) to access helper files

# papercheck 0.0.0.9037

* The way modules are created has been majorly changed -- it is now very similar to R package functions, using roxygen for documentation, instead of JSON format. There is no longer a need to distinguish text search, code, and LLM types of modules, they all use code. The vignettes have been updated to reflect this.
* Modules now return a `summary` table that is appended to a master summary table if you chain modules like `psychsci |> module_run("all_p_values") |> module_run("marginal")`
* The `validate()` function is temporarily removed to adapt the workflow to the new summary tables.
* new `module_help()` function and some help/examples in modules

* modules are now updated for clearer output, and added a new module vignette
* `llm()` no longer returns NA when the rate limit is hit, but slows down queries accordingly

* references are now converted to bibtex format, so are more complete and consistent
* Machine-learning module types are removed (the python/reticulate setup was too complex for many users), and instructions for how to create simple text feature models is included in the metascience vignette

* Error catching for `stats()` related to the above problem (and filed an issue on statcheck)
